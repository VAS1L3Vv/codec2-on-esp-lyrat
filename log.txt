General project information logging.
LATEST NEWS: 

-- Main is a little more organized. 
-- First ready implementation of codec2 element functions. Will be updating to make it work. 
-- Created switch-based mode selection and according to the mode speech and frame sizes.


-- Added debug log to codec2_data_init function to make sure the correct mode is set.
-- Added codec2_data_deinit function for deallocation upon pipeline termination. 
-- Moved Arduino initialisation block up a few lines in main so it starts sooner. 
-- Changed a couple of cfg names and LOGI messages iin main, nothing much. 
-- Added new log upon successful setdata execution for codec2 elements. 
-- added mode string selection per-case in codec2_data_init to log the selected mode. 

-- Massively increased different types of stack in menuconfig to avoid overflow,
   which is quite a common occurence by now. 
-- Enabled stack overflow guard to help detect overflows in the moment.
-- Added LOGI for codec2 user struct initialisation. 
-- Upped the elements' ringbuffer multiplier to 2, to help avoid overflow.
-- Added breaks to case statements. For fukcs sake Viktor, 
   I know you forgot C programming but that's a new low.
-- Changed codec2_data-> pointers to cdc2-> which is now easier to write. 
-- Tremendously fixed encoder2 and decoder2 process functions. Should work now. I hope.
-- Significantly increased enc2 dec2 task stack sizes, like 10 times. 
-- Massively increased task stack sizes overall.

--   !!!!! HURRRAY WE GOT SOUND!!!!! GARBAGE, BUT SOUND!!!!
